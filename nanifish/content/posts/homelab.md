# 1. Why start your Homelab
A Homelab is a personal lab for testing tech, networking, servers, etc. It provides the following benefits.

1. Hands-on learning (Linux, networking, virtualization, DevOps, etc.)
2. Career growth (Skills that impress employers)
3. Convenience (Media server, VPNs, backups)

# 2. What hardware to purchase/use
While professional server racks may cost you an arm and a leg, it is a myth that you need expensive enterprise gear to start a Homelab. Below are the beginner-friendly options:

1. Old laptop/PC
2. Raspberry Pi
3. Pre-built NAS

# 3. Common pitfalls
Approaching your homelab with a "productivity guilt" mindset—where only "useful" projects feel justified. Below are 3 reasons why You Should Embrace "Useless" Experiments.

Why You Should Embrace "Useless" Experiments
1. The Best Skills Come from "Wasted" Time

    Ever met someone who deeply understands Linux networking? They probably broke things for fun first.

    Example:

        "Useless" project: Hosting a Minecraft server on Kubernetes.

        Real skill gained: Learned K8s networking, persistent volumes, and Helm charts—now applicable to work.

2. Curiosity Drives Innovation

    Homelabs are sandboxes. The "what if?" moments lead to breakthroughs.

    Example:

        Tinkering with a Raspberry Pi cluster → Accidentally learned load balancing → Now you understand cloud scaling.

3. Prevents Burnout

    If everything is goal-driven, your lab feels like work. Let it be your playground.

    Try:

        Hosting a meme website with Apache.

        Making your smart fridge tweet.

        Running DOOM on a Docker container (because why not?).
